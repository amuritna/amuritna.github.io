&lt;p>As my projects progressed, the number of MATLAB figures to deal with at a time began to go past twenty, and I started developed frustration with MATLAB&amp;rsquo;s default way of arranging and displaying figures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are some of them:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Each chart is limited by the size of the figure window, and each figure window is limited by the size of the device screen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Therefore, to be able to display more figures, more windows have to launched. I started to feel messy once I started dealing with dozens of figures at a time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Individual figures cannot be wider or longer than device screen width or height, respectively.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Having to manually close or drag around the figure windows every time I re-run the script.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most importantly: You can show charts side-by-side in the same window — using subplot or the newer tiledlayout — but control over layout is limited.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For instance, tile spacing only has four options: &lt;code>loose&lt;/code>, &lt;code>compact&lt;/code>, &lt;code>tight&lt;/code>, &lt;code>none&lt;/code> (and &lt;code>none&lt;/code> does not really &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> like &amp;ldquo;no margins&amp;rdquo;, for me).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Since I felt that it was beginning to affect my work in a less ideal way, I began to wonder about the alternatives. What came to mind afterwards was programmatically exporting all the figures created and accessing them using a different application — but we can still go further.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
