If a [modular origami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_origami) construction is a book of fiction, then it is an anthology of tales, not a novel. <!--more-->

Each of its modular origami units is like a short story. First off, each component is relatively quick to be completed on its own. For instance, I only need a minute or two to fold a single piece of my one of my favorite modular origami units, the [sonobe module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonobe).

They can also be interpreted as self-contained "stand-alones". No unit serves as another unit's foundation; a crumpled unit does not necessarily a sloppy second unit make. In short: The properties of one unit I folded has no direct impact on the next one I make.

As a consequence, they are, in my opinion, noteworthy in their practicality. I do not need to check on my last progress before taking another step. I have no need for planning ahead. Each unit can be and is to be enjoyed on its own, in their own small pockets of time.

When traveling, I rarely have the time for long stretches of concentration (i.e., opportunity to mentally escape the real, physical world â€” there are train announcements to look out for, etc.) some other activities e.g. reading books require. But modular origami units? One of them is much less demanding on its own. I can just simply sit down, pull out a piece of paper from my wallet, spend two minutes folding guided by my memory, tuck back the result into my wallet, and forget about it. And repeat.

*And repeat.*

(The repetitive nature is a feature, not a bug. It is relaxing. And it makes modular origami an ideal low maintenance hobby.)

And so they are analogous to short stories (and less so to the chapters of a novel). And yet, even though each of them can already stand on their own<sup>[1]</sup>, they can also be combined and arranged and linked with others to make a synergy of a longer, *bigger* story.

A nice way to challenge yourself and spend two consecutive hours or three.<sup>[2]</sup>

A grander project.

## Footnotes

[1]: I do not, however, know anybody who folds modular origami units with the intention of treating them as standalones.

[2]: My ego insisted that I make a disclaimer that it was *not* the icosahedron of sonobe modules pictured that I would need more than an hour of assembly time for.
