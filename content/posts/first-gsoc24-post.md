I've been selected as one of [Google Summer of Code 2024](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024)'s contributors for [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org/), an electronic design automation (EDA) toolchain for digital [integrated circuits design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit_design) that deals with the [VLSI ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-large-scale_integration)design flow (RTL to GDSII).

The program I am a part of, [Open Source Research Experience 2024](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osre/), requires that all contributors post blog posts about their work.

My initial blog post can be found here: [Building Unit Tests for OpenROAD: Towards better code coverage!](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/report/osre24/ucsd/openroad/20240603-amuritna/)

Let's have a great summer!
