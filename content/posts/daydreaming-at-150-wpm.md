description: The art of walking on a narrow ledge, and what it felt like whenever I managed to go above 140 WPM.

i hit 150 wpm, although only once. i'm fascinated by how it felt like. 

- i hit 150 wpm
- the faster i try to be the harder it is to actually be fast
- typing fast is like walking on a ledge
- i go fast best when i'm daydreaming or thinking about other things
- i also think better when im typing nonsensical things
- i go fastest when i just type random dictionary words instead of actual sentences bcs actual sentences are distracting
- it is concentration but also not quite the traditional sort
- none of this has any real-world applicatiosn but it's fun. like memorizing the digits of pi.
- typing is the art of not thinking about typing.
