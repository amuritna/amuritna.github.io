Hello! My name is Emmanuella Rumanti, also known as amuritna [\[1\]](#notes). I can be contacted [via e-mail](mailto:amuritna@gmail.com). You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/emmanuella-rumanti/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/amuritna/).

At the moment, I am affliated with the School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics at [Institut Teknologi Bandung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandung_Institute_of_Technology), Indonesia, where I am in my last year of pursuing a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. My current work  — my team's capstone design project — focuses on the design of specialized hardware to secure voice communication on an untrusted device. 

My other interests include computer engineering, programming, register-transfer level design, instruction set architecture, firmware, chip design, open source software, and the combination of the last two (e.g. open source silicon compilers!).

### Notes

**[1]** Anagram for Arumanti, the slightly longer version of Rumanti.  
**[2]** Or maybe there is a secret third language option?
